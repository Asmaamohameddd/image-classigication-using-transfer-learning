 image-classification task, Two approaches are explored for customization: Feature Extraction and Fine-Tuning. In the Feature Extraction method, the representations learned by the pre-trained model are utilized to extract meaningful features from new samples. A new classifier is added and trained from scratch on top of the pre-trained model, allowing the repurposing of previously learned feature maps. This approach is efficient as it avoids retraining the entire model. The Fine-Tuning method involves unfreezing a few top layers of the frozen model base and jointly training both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model. This fine-tuning process refines higher-order feature representations in the base model to improve accuracy for the target dataset. The achieved accuracy for the model is 99.37%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in leveraging pre-trained models for custom tasks.
